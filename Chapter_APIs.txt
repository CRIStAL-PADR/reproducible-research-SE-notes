## Use Functions

### Write Short functions
- easier to read, understand and maintain
- use and re-use your own code

### Use as few parameters as you can
  When possible, use default arguments
  
### Use clear names
  Characters are cheap to type.
  The time needed to understand a cryptic piece of code is much more expensive.

### Document your functions
